Create environments here, in either the Role Ruby DSL (.rb) or JSON (.json) files. To install environments on the Chef Infra Server, use the knife command.

For example, in this directory, you'll find an example environment file called `example.json` which can be uploaded to the Chef Infra Server:

    knife environment from file environments/example.json

For more information on environments, see the Chef docs site:
