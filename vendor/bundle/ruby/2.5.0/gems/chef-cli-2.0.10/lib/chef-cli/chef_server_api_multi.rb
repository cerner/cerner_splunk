module ChefCLI

  # A wrapper for `Chef::ServerAPI` that supports multi-threading by creating a
  # `Chef::ServerAPI` object per-thread.
  #
  # This is intended to be used for downloading cookbooks from the Chef Infa Server,
  # where the API of the Chef Infra Server requires each file to be downloaded
  # individually.
  #
  # It also configures `Chef::ServerAPI` to enable keepalives by default. To
  # disable them, `keepalives: false` must be set in the options to the
  # constructor.
