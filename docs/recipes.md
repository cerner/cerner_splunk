Recipes
=======
These are all of the public facing recipes, and brief descriptions of what they do. Only one Installation recipe can be on your runlist at a time (since the Splunk UF and the full Splunk instance can both perform the same tasks of consuming data to be sent along).

Forwarder Installation Recipes
------------------------------
### `cerner_splunk` / `cerner_splunk::forwarder`

Installs the Splunk Universal Forwarder on your system. Most people will only want this recipe (hence why it's the default recipe)

### `cerner_splunk::heavy_forwarder`

Installs the Enterprise Splunk artifact on your system to be configured as a heavy forwarder.

### `cerner_splunk::image_prep`

Makes a Universal Forwarder part of a host image.

Server Installation Recipes
---------------------------
These are installations of Full Splunk. Unless you are a Splunk Administrator, these are not the droids you are looking for.

Unconfiguration / Uninstallation Recipes
----------------------------------------
These are recipes to remove and clean up aspects of Splunk

**_EXPERIMENTAL_** Removes a search head member from the Search Head Cluster and stops Splunk. It's currently troublesome re-adding a removed head back to a Search Head Cluster.
